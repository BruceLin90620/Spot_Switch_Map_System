# Spor_Switch_Map_System

## Overview
This work presents an advanced inspection system utilizing Boston Dynamics' Spot for autonomous industrial monitoring in collaboration with TSMC. The system integrates Routing System, Multi-Map navigation, and digital twin simulation through NVIDIA Isaac Sim to enhance operational efficiency in large-scale environments. By combining these technologies, we establish a scalable, memory-efficient, and highly reliable framework for autonomous industrial inspection.


## **Map Switching System**
- Optimizes memory usage by eliminating the need to load an entire large-scale map

- Enhances scalability, enabling efficient expansion of mapped areas

- Ensures precise localization, with AprilTags setting Spotâ€™s initial pose after each transition

By partitioning large spaces into manageable sub-maps and leveraging AprilTag-assisted positioning, we enable reliable and efficient navigation throughout extensive factory environments.
